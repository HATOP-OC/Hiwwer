      "q2": "Can I cancel an order?",
      "a2": "Yes, you can cancel an order before the performer starts working. If the performer has already started working, the cancellation and refund terms depend on the specific performer and the order conditions. Always read the cancellation policy before placing an order.",
      "q3": "How long are the order files stored?",
      "a3": "Order files and materials are stored on the platform for 3 months after the order is completed. We recommend downloading all materials immediately after accepting the work.",
      "q4": "Will I receive a license to use the ordered work?",
      "a4": "By default, all rights for commercial use are transferred to the customer upon acceptance of the work and full payment. However, the specific licensing terms may vary depending on the type of service and the performer's conditions. Be sure to discuss this with the performer before ordering.",
      "q5": "How does payment for additional services work?",
      "a5": "If additional services or an expansion of the scope of work are needed during the order, the performer can offer additional services through the system. You can accept or decline these offers. If accepted, the additional amount will be added to your order."

      "q2": "How can I offer additional services to a client?",
      "a2": "You can offer additional services through the 'Additional Options' system on the order page. The client will receive a notification with your offer and can accept or decline it. If the client accepts, the cost of the additional services will be added to the total order amount.",
      "q3": "What if I need more time to complete an order?",
      "a3": "If you need to extend the deadline, you should inform the client as soon as possible through the messaging system. Propose a new completion date and explain the reasons for the delay. The client can accept or decline your request. Important: regular delays can negatively affect your rating and visibility in search results.",
      "q4": "Can I offer discounts to regular clients?",
      "a4": "Yes, you can offer discounts to regular clients through the coupon system. In your performer dashboard, there is a 'Discounts and Promo Codes' section where you can create personal coupons for individual clients or general promo codes for certain categories of clients. Discounts are applied to the order value, but the platform commission is calculated from the original service price.",
      "q5": "How can I dispute an unfair review?",
      "a5": "If you believe you have received an unfair review, you can dispute it through the support system. To do this, go to the review page and click 'Dispute Review'. You will need to provide a detailed explanation and evidence to support your position. Moderators will review your complaint and make a decision within 5 business days. Please note that only reviews that violate the platform's rules or contain inaccurate information can be disputed."
